## Imaginary Traveler

_Cloud that I float on, carry me to Peru
send to me exotic birds, bearing gifts of aqua blue_

_Lets take a detour through the mountains of Kandahar 
for it doesn't bother me if I come out with battle scars_

_Oh please, oh please can we stop in Dharamsala
I have some questions to ask His Holiness, the Dalai Lama_

_Cloud, if its possible can we please time travel?
I want to see how they built the pyramids from dirt, stone, and gravel_

_Lets defy gravity, next stop Andromeda
being 2 million light-years away we'll see scores of space phenomena_

_Our next and final stop shall be a place called peace
take me there, please cloud, but on the way lets visit Greece._
